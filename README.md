# Rowey-FAF-Tourney-Info-DB

## Why am i doing this
I recived a Excel Doc with 1v1 Tournament Data from a FAF Player with over 5500 Recored in it.
The aim is to provide a better interface to extract usfull infoamion out of the data as well as using it as a learning curve for myself

## Aim for this
For now this is the current filter i plan to add for all this data
 - [ ] Filter By Players
 - [ ] keep track of Know Player name and their Current & past rename's
 - [ ] Filter By Faction
 - [ ] Filter By Map
 - [ ] Filter by Map size
 - [ ] Filter by Tournament
 - [ ] Filter by Year

## Website
Thier will be a web front end to interact with this to make it easyer to use with and majority of people will be able to jsut view the data with a select few who have accses to add/ update data
